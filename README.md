A CRYPTO TOKEN FOR DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY IN EDUCATION
Abstract
Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to address data privacy and security concerns in the education sector. 
This abstract explores how blockchain enhances data privacy and security in education by providing a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger for storing educational records. With blockchain, students have greater control over their data, granting permission for access and revoking it as needed. 
Blockchain also streamlines credential verification, reducing reliance on manual processes and minimizing the risk of fraudulent credentials. Selective information sharing and secure data transfer further enhance privacy and reduce the risk of data breaches. 
Blockchain acts as a deterrent to academic fraud by ensuring transparency and immutability. Implementing blockchain in education requires scalability, interoperability, and cybersecurity measures. By leveraging blockchain's decentralization, immutability, and transparency, the education sector can revolutionize record storage, verification, and sharing while prioritizing data protection.
